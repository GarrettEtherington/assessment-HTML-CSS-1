        <p id="expoZ">The least famous person in the whole wide world whorld, Mann Gunn, otherwise known as Pogglesnash, Shmare, Yuko (no one calls him that), Iron Arms, Gugmeiser Manson, and many more names that are totally in no way at all a type of insult or could ever be construed as one.<br> <br> Mann Gunn is not known for his amazing cooking skills, as kooking is not the man's calling, what means most to Gunn, is the sounds and power, of music. He began writing music at the age of twelve, and sucked so freaking bad that people would pay money not to listen to his crap, (as you should with most young music artists). However, he was too arrogant to hear otherwise from anyone else, and kept writing music most every day for seven years, until today, where his least anticipated EP yet, <i>Squid On The Moon,</i> is just right down the road! </p>

        
        <div id = bio>
            <p id ="ligma">Mann Gunn was born in a desert cave, and raised by sand monkeys. it wasn't until Gunn was around six years old that he found his first bass guitar, to witch he got so funky with it, the entire cave collapsed, sealing him away from his monkey brethren, and changing his life, forever.</p>
